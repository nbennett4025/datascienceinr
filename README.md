This is my repository for the final markdown in the Evans School Data Science in R skills workshop.

The County Elections CSV is a small amount of data that provide the historic eleciton information used in the markdown.

The .RMD is the R markdown file that I used to generate the pdf.

The pdf document is the result of running the markdown.

Thanks for a great class!
